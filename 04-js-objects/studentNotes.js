// this is where you can take notes without risking merge conflicts when you pull down new code from Github (the remote is called origin => i.e., where your online repo for this directory is located)
//const arr = [ 1, 2 , 3, 4]
//const me ={name: "Elna", job: "teacher", faveFood: "tofu"}

//me["update-name"] = "Soleil"
//let friend = 'josh'
//me[friend] = josh
// also feel free to use this as a sandbox!

//Pokemon ASSIGNMENT: Define a pokemon variable and assign it to an object containing name, img, and likes keys. The value of likes should be 0 while name and img can be whatever pokemon character data you like. 'img' should be an address as a string. (Doesnt have to be a working url)

// const pokemon = {
  //  name: "Pikachu", 
 //   img: "https://imageofPikachu.com", 
  //  likes: 0
// }
// 
// const pokemon = {
  //  name : "Growlithe" ,
 //   likes: 0,
  //  img : "https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Growlithe_(Pok%C3%A9mon)",
//}
//

//What would happen if we set a name key = to a value and then try to initialize another key with the same name?
//Object.key -exact key name
//object[key] // if using a variable
// object["new-key"] - if key contains non-standard chars
// *(same as spread)* object.assign(target, existingObj, newProps)

// Define a function increaseValue() that should take 2 parameters: 'object' and 'key' by 1 so that every time the function is invoked, the number of likes will increment.
//function increaseValue(obj , key) {
 //   return obj[key]++
                 //+= 1 (works too)
//}

//increaseValue(pokemon, "likes")

//const pokemon = {
   // name: 'pikachu',
   // age:7,
   // likes: 0,
//}



// **** assignmment due thursday: -- create a new complex object that fills in data to represent you, 
//and practice accessing various properties manually. 
//Then write functions to try to access those same values:*****//



// Running the file ```node notes.js``` (without the backticks) will allow you to explore/play around with code. Make sure you have cd'ed into the inner folder before you do this.
